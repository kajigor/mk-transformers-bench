\frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We developed and implemented Conservative Partial Deduction
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Less-branching heuristics
    \end{itemize}
    \item Evaluation shows some improvement, but not for every query
    \item Future work:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Develop models to predict execution time
      \item Develop specialization which is more predictable, stable and well-behaved
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
